            {/*<p>Hi! I'm Hanna - a self taught programmer enjoying life in Massachusetts. After graduating with a business management degree and spending eight years in the field, I left the business world behind and began to pursue my passion for coding.
            
            Through various online resources and routine work with a mentor - I have taught myself a variety of languages, libraries, and web development skills. I always enjoy a challenge, and have the ability to teach myself nearly anything that I put my mind to. 

            I am passionate about my fur-family, to-do lists, running obscenely long distances, creating things with my hands, and solving puzzles.
